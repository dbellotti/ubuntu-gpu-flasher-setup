# ubuntu-gpu-flasher-setup

For any ubuntu based os, the following script will do a bunch of installs then open up one click timing patch against the plugged in gpu. I typically use this with an ubuntu live usb, since it doesn't have persistent storage between restarts, this can be used for convenience.

```
$ wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dbellotti/6189e196d0aa8953ec7f8748e54f96d7/raw/618d01067be80098ef38085b2c57bc48ad7045f2/setup-ubuntu-live && chmod +x setup-ubuntu-live && ./setup-ubuntu-live
```

or if you have to manually type it in
```
$ wget https://bit.ly/2XSIkNy && chmod +x 2XSIkNy && ./2XSIkNy
```
